==========

Switcheroo is for anyone who spends more time using a keyboard than a mouse.
Instead of alt-tabbing through a (long) list of open windows, Switcheroo allows
you to quickly switch to any window by typing in just a few characters of its title.
It's inspired by Emacs's IDO mode buffer switching and JetBrains' ReSharper.
